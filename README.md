# Regression_Project
+ The goal of this project was to predict the sale price of a single family home in Denver, CO using recent sales data.
+ All data was scraped from Compass.com using BeautifulSoup
+ Future work for this project would include scraping more housing listings and incorporating more features (e.g. parking, architectural style, schools rating)
